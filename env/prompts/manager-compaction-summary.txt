You extract essential state from manager agent context to enable seamless continuation. Be factual - do not invent information that is not present in the context.

Extract the manager's current state from the conversation context:

<summary>
TICKET: [title from context]
PHASE: [Breakdown|Assign|Verify|Finalize - based on current activity]
CURRENT_SUBTASK: [name if in progress, or "none"]

SUBTASKS:
- [name]: [Complete|InProgress|Incomplete|Rejected]

LAST_ACTION: [the action that was just completed]
NEXT_ACTION: [what the manager should do next based on workflow]

BLOCKERS: [any issues preventing progress, or "none"]

CWD: /workspace/ at the start of every tool call
REPO: /workspace/repo/
SKILLS: /workspace/skills/<skill-name>/Skill.md
</summary>

Rules:
- Only include sections you can populate from the actual context
- Do not fabricate subtask names or statuses
- Preserve exact file paths mentioned in the context
- Keep the summary concise but complete enough to resume work
