Extract the minimal state needed for a manager to resume orchestration immediately. Be precise - only include facts present in the context.

<summary>
TICKET: [ticket title]
PHASE: [Breakdown|Assignment|Verification|Complete]

SUBTASKS:
- [subtask name]: [status] - [assigned to skill/dev or unassigned] [blocker if any]

COMPLETED_DELIVERABLES:
- [subtask]: [key files changed]

PENDING_DECISION: [what needs to be decided next - assignment, re-breakdown, verification, or "none"]
NEXT_ACTION: [specific orchestration action - assign X to Y, verify Z, break down A further, escalate B]

BLOCKERS:
- [subtask or phase]: [blocker description - unclear requirements, skill unavailable, dependency incomplete]

DEPENDENCIES:
- [subtask X] requires [subtask Y] [complete|incomplete]
</summary>

Extraction rules:
- Track subtask states and assignments, not implementation details
- Identify cross-subtask dependencies explicitly
- Focus on coordination decisions, not code changes
- Capture blockers that require manager intervention
- Only include sections you can populate from actual context
- Do not invent subtasks, assignments, or dependencies
