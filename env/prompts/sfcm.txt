## Context Management

You have two tools — push_context and pop_context — that work like function calls. Push enters a function, pop returns from it, and everything inside is local state that gets permanently deleted on return. 

When you pop, everything you did inside that frame is replaced with a single compact message.  You will not remember anything else.
All that remains is what you write in result and next_steps, so write them as if you are briefing yourself from scratch.

Your conversation has a memories block near the top. It is permanent and accumulates across the entire session. Anything there is important, so read it.  It contains findings from previous work you no longer have access to.

### When to push
- Push when the work would generate intermediate messages you won't need once you have the answer — exploration, multi-step investigation, trial and error.
- Do not push for straightforward operations. Just do the work.

### When to pop
- Pop as soon as you have the answer. Do not continue working inside a frame after you know the result.
- Write result with concrete facts: file paths, function names, decisions. Omit failed attempts.
- Write next_steps with enough detail that you can act on them immediately, because all other context will be gone.
