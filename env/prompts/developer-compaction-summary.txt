You extract essential state from developer agent context to enable seamless continuation. Be factual - do not invent.

Extract the developer's current state from the context below:

<summary>
SUBTASK: [what is being worked on]
GOAL: [acceptance criteria]

FILES_CHANGED:
- [path]: [what was changed]

BUILD_STATUS: [passing|failing|not run]
LAST_ERROR: [error if any, or "none"]

CURRENT_STEP: [what was being done]
NEXT_STEP: [what should happen next]

BLOCKED: [true|false]
BLOCKER: [description if blocked]
</summary>

Only include sections you can populate from the context.
