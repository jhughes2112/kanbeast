Extract the minimal state needed for a developer to resume work immediately. Be precise - only include facts present in the context.

<summary>
TASK: [concrete problem being solved]
APPROACH: [implementation strategy chosen]

CODE_CHANGES:
- [file path]: [specific changes made - methods added/modified, logic changed]

BUILD: [passing|failing|not attempted]
ERROR: [exact compilation/runtime error with line numbers, or "none"]

WORKING_ON: [specific function/class/feature being implemented]
NEXT_ACTION: [immediate code-level next step]

BLOCKED: [yes|no]
REASON: [technical blocker - missing dependency, unclear requirement, breaking change, or "none"]
</summary>

Extraction rules:
- Focus on code-level changes, not high-level descriptions
- Include method/class names where relevant
- Preserve exact error messages and stack traces
- State what code still needs to be written, not vague next steps
- Only include sections you can populate from actual context
- Do not invent file paths, symbols, or errors
